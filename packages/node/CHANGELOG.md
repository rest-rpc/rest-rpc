# @rest-rpc/node

## 0.1.0-beta.20

### Minor Changes

- d72a045: Replace inferred and explicitly declared form array keys with bracket notation serialization across query parameters, URL-encoded forms, and multipart forms.
- 45d0fca: Use each framework's native error-handling flow for request and response validation failures. Replace the shared server error-handler API with exported validation error classes and adapter-specific hooks allowing for more native feeling error handling.
- d72a045: Remove flattened request keys convention and make each http declaration specify the request segments
- d72a045: Remove support of returning undeclared headers through server handler. Remove set-cookie header helpers
- d72a045: Remove the WebSocket and server-sent events abstractions, including their route builders, client and server helpers, adapter options, and related public types.
- 45d0fca: Add server-first route declarations and implementations, typed clients derived from server implementations, and matching TanStack Query helpers. Add new `@rest-rpc/node` adapter for serving routes directly with Node HTTP `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` handler.
