## 0.1.0-beta.25

## 0.1.0-beta.24

### Minor Changes

- fec6317: Rename the adapter `RouteHandler` type to `InferServerHandler` to match the `Infer*` style of the core helpers. `InferServerHandler` now expects a plain return value for `.output()` routes instead of a status envelope. Remove `RouteRequest` and `RouteErrors` from the adapter roots: use `InferServerRequest` for the validated request, `Parameters<InferServerHandler<typeof route>>[0]` for the full handler argument, and `Extract<InferServerResponse<typeof route>, { status: 404 }>` for specific status responses.
- fec6317: Type helpers accept a route tree as well as a single route and infer a matching tree of types, so one exported type can be indexed per route: `InferServerRequest<typeof routes>["todos"]["create"]`. This applies to `InferClientRequest`, `InferClientResponse`, `InferServerRequest`, `InferServerResponse`, the adapter `InferServerHandler`, and the TanStack Query `Infer*` helpers. Add `InferClientStreamData` to `@rest-rpc/core`, which infers the `data` of each event received from a streaming route without the `SseEvent` wrapper.

## 0.1.0-beta.23

### Minor Changes

- d72a045: Replace direct application context property access with a typed per-request `context.get(key)` and `context.set(key, value)` store.
- d72a045: Add .$context<T>() for ther route builder to specify context for specific set of routes. Remove providing initial context option from route registeration.

### Patch Changes

- 8db54c8: Allow path to be omitted from http methods in route builder. enforce leading slash in paths in types.
- 5676c02: Allow reusable context type and middleware for implement api
- 5676c02: add options to disable request and response validation across server adapters

## 0.1.0-beta.22

### Minor Changes

- d72a045: more flexible route builder
- d72a045: centralize type helpers

## 0.1.0-beta.21

### Patch Changes

- 5676c02: re-export type<T>() helper from all server adapters

## 0.1.0-beta.20

### Minor Changes

- d72a045: Replace inferred and explicitly declared form array keys with bracket notation serialization across query parameters, URL-encoded forms, and multipart forms.
- d72a045: Add custom codecs support for fetch client and server adapters
- 45d0fca: Use each framework's native error-handling flow for request and response validation failures. Replace the shared server error-handler API with exported validation error classes and adapter-specific hooks allowing for more native feeling error handling.
- d72a045: Remove flattened request keys convention and make each http declaration specify the request segments
- d72a045: Remove support of returning undeclared headers through server handler. Remove set-cookie header helpers
- d72a045: Remove the WebSocket and server-sent events abstractions, including their route builders, client and server helpers, adapter options, and related public types.
- 45d0fca: Add server-first route declarations and implementations, typed clients derived from server implementations, and matching TanStack Query helpers. Add new `@rest-rpc/node` adapter for serving routes directly with Node HTTP `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` handler.

## 0.1.0-beta.19

### Minor Changes

- 1ea1c91: Redesign contract declaration around fluent, per-route builders. This is a
  breaking beta change that replaces object-shaped route declarations with plain
  contract trees composed from `route.get()`, `route.post()`, `route.sse()`, and
  `route.ws()` builders.

Request locations are now declared through builder methods such as `.params()`,
`.query()`, `.headers()`, and `.body()`. These methods accept whole-location
schemas, allowing schema input and output generics to document client transport
values and validated handler values directly. `pathParams` has also been renamed
to `params` across contracts, grouped client inputs, handlers, and server adapter
boundaries.

Response statuses are now explicit. Use repeated `.response(status, schema)`
calls for ordinary responses and `.response(status)` for responses without a
body. Dedicated builder methods cover form, multipart, custom-content, streamed,
SSE, and WebSocket requests and responses. Shared route configuration now uses
`route.with()`, while route-specific OpenAPI metadata uses `.withOpenApi()`.

WebSocket declarations now consistently produce `{ type, message }` envelopes
through `.clientMessage()` and `.serverMessage()` instead of supporting multiple
competing message representations.

The redesign makes route declarations discoverable through autocomplete,
standardizes previously overlapping representations, and reduces the runtime
and type-level complexity required to normalize contracts. Clients, servers,
adapters, OpenAPI generation, TanStack Query helpers, tests, benchmarks, and
documentation have been updated to consume the new route representation.
